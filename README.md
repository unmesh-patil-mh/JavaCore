## 🧠 What is Java?

**Java** is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent** programming language developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by Oracle).

### 🔹 Key Features of Java
- **Platform Independent** (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
- **Object-Oriented**
- **Secure**
- **Robust**
- **Multithreaded**
- **High Performance**
- **Portable**
- **Distributed**

Java programs are compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

## ⚙️ Java Architecture

1. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
   - Used to develop Java applications  
   - Includes JRE + development tools

2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**  
   - Used to run Java applications  
   - Includes JVM + core libraries

3. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**  
   - Executes Java bytecode  
   - Makes Java platform-independent
